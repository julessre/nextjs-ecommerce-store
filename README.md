<h1>Next.js ecommerce store</h1>

<h2>About this project üìù</h2>
The ecommerce shop is an UpLeveled project, where I have to design and create a full stack ecommerce website using next.js.
Main features are:

- workshop page: here a user can find a list of all upcoming workshops
- single workshop page: when a product is clicked by the user it directs to this page, where description and detials can be found, the quantity can be edited and the item can be added to the cart
- cart page: shows all workshops added to the cart including their quantity (which can be edited), price, a delete button to delete an item from the cart, the total price of all the products in the cart and a checkout button
- checkout page: shows the total, an order summary and asks for shipping and payment information
- thank you page: after confirming the order, the user gets directed to the thank you page
